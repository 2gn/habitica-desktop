# habitica-desktop
## description
very simple, cross-platform [habitica](https://habitica.com) client.
<br>I was inspired by [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)'s [new feature](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle/releases/tag/v0.49) that flows user-specific "todo app" on the side of the screen.
